A `SheetRun` takes the option `compile`, for example `tiered` of `@mark1russell7/vex-compiler` (SHEET.COMPILE). The run evaluates each formula of a column with its compiled program, and the results stay the results of the interpreter. A formula compiles once for each compiler and its options, also across runs. The test kit exports the arbitraries of random sheets: `arbSheet`, `arbTwoTables` and `arbSheetFormula`.
