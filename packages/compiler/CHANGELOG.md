## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 431bea0: A binding of `let` can be a function: `fn(params, body)`. The node `call(name, ...args)` applies it (FN.BIND, FN.CALL). The body evaluates at the position of the call, with the names of the place of its binding. A function cannot call itself, so each call ends (FN.TOTAL). `deps` reads the body at each call. Tier 2 puts the body at each call, in at most 10000 places. A standalone module prints one JavaScript function for each function and each set of kinds of its arguments. The JSON Schema of the IR has the two nodes. The reference interpreter and the random programs of the test kit have functions too.
  
  In the builder, `root.fn(kinds, body)` makes a function with the kinds of its parameters (BUILD.FN). `functions(fns, body)` of a chain binds functions and gives a typed call of each.
- f85789c: Lists as values. A `let` binds a list, and a list op applies to its name (LIST.VALUE). The axis `list(expr)` has the keys of the items of a list as targets, in the order of the list (AXIS.LIST). `sortBy(list)` sorts the items by their values, `take(list, n)` gives the first items and `nth(list, i)` gives one value. Tier 2 gives a reason for a program with lists, and tier 1 evaluates it. A standalone module keeps each list as an array. The reference interpreter and the random programs of the test kit have lists too.
  
  A list chain of the builder has `sortBy()`, `take(n)`, `nth(i)` and `each(body)`, the axis list over its items (BUILD.LIST.ORDER).
- 1520434: The axis `reverse(axis)` has the targets of an axis in the reverse order, from the last to the first (AXIS.REVERSE). The inner axis is a base axis: not `where`, `reverse` or `table`. A fold over it starts at the last target, for example to pack a row from its last child. The builder has the option `reverse: true` of each axis. Tier 2 and a standalone module loop from the end, and the reference interpreter and the random programs of the test kit have the axis too.

### Minor Changes

- 344f306: The moves `key` and `index` take an expression for the key or the position (NAV.COMPUTED), as `INDEX` of a spreadsheet. The expressions of an address evaluate first, at the node, and then the moves apply. A key that is not a text, or a position that is not a number, gives `#VALUE!`. `deps` keeps the expression in the address and gives its reads (DEPS.COMPUTED). The builder takes a chain in `.index()` and `.to()`.
  
  The type `Move` now has `key: string | Expr` and `i: number | Expr`. The new type `FixedMove` has only fixed values: `applyMove`, `resolveAddr` and a cell reference take it, and `fixAddr` gives it. A cell reference takes only fixed moves. The reference interpreter and the random programs of the test kit have computed moves. Tier 2 and the standalone modules evaluate them with no fallback.
- 6a9728e: Kinds of domains (KIND.DOMAIN): a value of a domain without a primitive type has the kind `domain:Name`. An op with `returns: "domain"` gives this kind, a schema can declare it for a field, and a site on such a value is static. Thus a standalone module can hold the values of a kernel: a domain of plain data, for example a structure that a fold builds. A domain declares `samples`, and a module checks each copy of an op with them. A module checks a field of such a kind with a copy of `is` of the domain.
- e6a565f: The kinds (KIND.PRIMITIVE, KIND.RETURNS, KIND.STATIC). A domain can declare `primitive`, the JavaScript type of its values, and an op can declare `returns`, the kind of its result. The scalar domains declare both, and the law checker of the test kit checks both. `generate` and `tiered` take a `schema` with the kinds of the fields and the variables. An op site whose values have known kinds calls its op with no guard, and a value against the schema goes to tier 1.
- 7c2d0c3: Bounded loops: the expressions `fold` and `iterate` (LOOP.NAMES, FOLD.ORDER, FOLD.ERROR, ITERATE.LIMIT, ITERATE.UNTIL, ITERATE.ERROR). `init` gives the names of a loop and their first values, and `step` gives the next values. A fold makes one step at each target of an axis, in order. An iteration makes up to `limit` steps, a whole number from 0 to 100000, and a true `until` stops it. `result` gives the value. The builder has `fold` on a list chain and `iterate` on a chain. The reference interpreter and the random programs of the test kit have the loops. Tier 2 and the standalone modules compile them to loops with a variable for each name, and a loop that reads no key of the run evaluates once for each run.
- a87c033: `emitModule(expr, options)` prints a program as a standalone ES module with no import of Vex (COMPILE.MODULE). The module checks the schema of its input once. It gives the value of the interpreter at each key, or `VEX_ERROR` for an error of Vex. Each op is the text of the function of its domain, so the results have the same bits as the interpreter. The module has statements and loops. A part that depends on no key evaluates once, and an aggregate by group or by prefix evaluates its items once.
- 124a3d4: The new package `@mark1russell7/vex-compiler` turns a program into JavaScript source. `tiered(expr, options)` gives a program with the interface of `compile`, and its results are the results of the interpreter (COMPILE.TIERED, property P17). The source has the fast path of each op site for the domains of the options. On the programs of the speed lane, the generated code is 1.0 to 1.13 times the hand-written loops, and 70 to 110 times faster than `compile`. Where it cannot give a result, `compile` gives it (COMPILE.FALLBACK). A program keeps the value of each node that depends only on the space, for example the total of a column, so a run at each key of a space costs O(n) (COMPILE.MEMO). A node that reads the origin only through a few values has an entry for each value, so an aggregate by group evaluates once for each group (COMPILE.GROUP).
  
  The core exports `isFieldName`, `safeIs` and `matchesKind` for the compiler. Each space of the core has `records`, the records in the order of the keys (SPACE.RECORDS).

### Patch Changes

- f55e076: Columns of the run in a standalone module. A part of a loop over the targets whose value depends only on the target and on the constants of the run evaluates once for each record, on its first read (helper `Q`). Two parts with the same structure share one column. The full ring of the radial pilot is approximately ten times faster, and its module is smaller.
- c0fda11: A constant of the run with a loop is lazy in a standalone module: it evaluates on its first read, with the helper `L`. Before, a module evaluated each constant before the run, also a loop in a branch that no run takes.
- d376e73: V-051: The address of the axis `all` can fail at some keys. The memo of tier 2 took a list op over such an axis as a value of the space, so tier 2 gave the value of the first key at each key. Now only an address that depends on no key keeps the list op in the memo, and a standalone module evaluates the address too.
- 990a858: V-052: A move from the focus can fail before a fixed key, an index or the origin, for example `[offset(1), key("0")]` at the last key. The memo of tier 2 took such an address as a fixed key, so tier 2 gave the value of another key. A standalone module kept only the code of the last move. Now the address reads its start, and a module keeps the check of each move that can fail.
- 159c1ab: V-053: A node with a tag that the version does not know made `compile` throw a `TypeError`, for example a program with `fold` in 0.6.0. Now `compile`, `evaluate` and a sheet check the shape of the expression first (EVAL.SHAPE). An expression that is not valid gives `#VALUE!` with the reason. The new function `shapeError` gives the reason. The compiler gives the same error through tier 1, and `emitModule` gives the reason.
- 2383c3b: Vectors as plain data, for a standalone module. `XYDomain` has the component-wise ops of `Vec2Domain` for `{ x, y }` objects, and each op is a function, so `emitModule` can copy the domain. The op `xy` of `NumDomain` makes a value of it. An op can declare a result of another domain with `returns: "domain:Name"` (KIND.RETURNS): the compiler knows the kind of the result, and the law checker of the test kit checks such a result when its new option `domains` has that domain.
