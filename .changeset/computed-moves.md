The moves `key` and `index` take an expression for the key or the position (NAV.COMPUTED), as `INDEX` of a spreadsheet. The expressions of an address evaluate first, at the node, and then the moves apply. A key that is not a text, or a position that is not a number, gives `#VALUE!`. `deps` keeps the expression in the address and gives its reads (DEPS.COMPUTED). The builder takes a chain in `.index()` and `.to()`.

The type `Move` now has `key: string | Expr` and `i: number | Expr`. The new type `FixedMove` has only fixed values: `applyMove`, `resolveAddr` and a cell reference take it, and `fixAddr` gives it. A cell reference takes only fixed moves. The reference interpreter and the random programs of the test kit have computed moves. Tier 2 and the standalone modules evaluate them with no fallback.
