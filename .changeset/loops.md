Bounded loops: the expressions `fold` and `iterate` (LOOP.NAMES, FOLD.ORDER, FOLD.ERROR, ITERATE.LIMIT, ITERATE.UNTIL, ITERATE.ERROR). `init` gives the names of a loop and their first values, and `step` gives the next values. A fold makes one step at each target of an axis, in order. An iteration makes up to `limit` steps, a whole number from 0 to 100000, and a true `until` stops it. `result` gives the value. The builder has `fold` on a list chain and `iterate` on a chain. The reference interpreter and the random programs of the test kit have the loops. Tier 2 and the standalone modules compile them to loops with a variable for each name, and a loop that reads no key of the run evaluates once for each run.
